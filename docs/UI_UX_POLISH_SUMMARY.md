## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Theme System**
   - Context API for global state
   - localStorage for persistence (key: 'chilly-theme')
   - MediaQuery API for system preference detection
   - CSS class strategy (dark class on root element)
   
2. **Search Implementation**
   - URL-based state management (useSearchParams)
   - Debounced search (300ms) to reduce API calls
   - Navigation to home preserves search context
   - Clean separation of concerns

3. **IPC Communication**
   - Type-safe Electron API with TypeScript declarations
   - Async/await pattern for clean error handling
   - Preload script for secure context bridge
   - Graceful degradation when Electron unavailable

### Code Quality

- ‚úÖ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ‚úÖ No compilation warnings
- ‚úÖ Consistent code formatting
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling throughout
- ‚úÖ Type safety maintained
- ‚úÖ Accessibility considerations
- ‚úÖ Responsive design patterns

## User Experience Improvements

### Before ‚Üí After

**Theme Management:**
- Before: Broken toggle, no persistence, inconsistent colors

**Download Location:**
- Before: Browse button non-functional
- After: Native OS directory picker, toast notifications, loading states

## Known Limitations

1. **Download Location Picker**
   - Only functional in packaged Electron app
   - Web mode shows informational message
   - Path validation deferred to download time

2. **Video Player**
   - Currently a stub implementation
   - Full implementation requires packaging
   - File access limited by Electron security

3. **Search**
   - Uses hash router due to Electron file:// protocol
   - Special characters automatically encoded
   - No search history yet

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Sort torrents by seeders/size
- [ ] Multiple download locations
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Advanced search options
- [ ] Theme customization (colors)
- [ ] Animated transitions
- [ ] Progress persistence across restarts

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Speckit Workflow:** Planning first saved time debugging later
2. **Type Safety:** TypeScript caught many potential bugs early
3. **Incremental Commits:** Easy to track changes and roll back if needed
4. **Context API:** Perfect choice for theme management
5. **URL Params:** Elegant solution for search state

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Electron Security:** Context isolation required IPC bridges
2. **Theme Persistence:** Handled localStorage with graceful fallbacks
3. **Optimistic UI:** Implemented rollback for failed deletions
4. **Bilingual Support:** Maintained complete translation coverage
5. **Type Definitions:** Properly typed optional Electron API

### What Could Be Better
1. **Test Coverage:** Should write automated tests alongside features
2. **Documentation:** Could use more inline code comments
3. **Error Boundaries:** Need component-level error handling
4. **Validation:** Path validation should happen at selection time
5. **Animations:** Could use more consistent animation patterns
