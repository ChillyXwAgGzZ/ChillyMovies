**What We Index**:
- ChillyMovies' optional torrent search feature indexes publicly available torrent **metadata** (titles, file sizes, torrent hashes)
- We do **NOT** host, store, transmit, or distribute any media files or copyrighted content
- We act as a search indexer, similar to a search engine

**What We Can Remove**:
- ✓ Torrent metadata from search results
- ✓ Torrent hashes/magnet links from our index
- ✓ Search results pointing to specific content

**What We Cannot Remove**:
- ✗ Content hosted on third-party sites or networks

- ✗ Content from other torrent indexers or trackers

**Important**: To fully remove content from the internet, you must contact:
1. The actual hosts/uploaders of the files
2. Other torrent indexers that list the content
3. Torrent trackers that coordinate downloads
4. ISPs or hosting providers
