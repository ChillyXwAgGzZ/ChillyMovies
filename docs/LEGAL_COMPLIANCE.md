## Takedown Reporting Process

### DMCA Takedown Request Handling

#### Step 1: Provide Clear Contact Information

Create a dedicated page/section for DMCA notices:

```markdown
## DMCA Takedown Notices

If you believe content indexed by ChillyMovies infringes your copyright,
please submit a DMCA takedown notice containing:

1. Your contact information (name, address, phone, email)
2. Identification of the copyrighted work
3. Identification of the infringing material (torrent hash/magnet link)
4. A statement of good faith belief that use is not authorized
5. A statement under penalty of perjury that information is accurate
6. Your physical or electronic signature

Send notices to:
Email: dmca@chillymovies.example.com
Physical: [Your DMCA Agent Address]

We will respond within 48 hours during business days.
```

#### Step 2: Implement Takedown Workflow

```typescript
// Example takedown tracking structure
interface TakedownRequest {
  id: string;
  requestDate: Date;
  requesterEmail: string;
  copyrightHolder: string;
  contentIdentifier: string; // torrent hash or magnet link
  description: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'processed' | 'rejected';
  processedDate?: Date;
  notes?: string;
}
```

**Workflow**:
1. **Receive Request** ‚Üí Log all details, send acknowledgment within 24 hours
2. **Verify Request** ‚Üí Ensure request meets DMCA requirements
3. **Remove Content** ‚Üí Blacklist torrent hash from search results
4. **Notify User** ‚Üí If applicable, inform affected users (if downloads in progress)
5. **Counter-Notice** ‚Üí Provide process for counter-notifications
6. **Document** ‚Üí Keep records for at least 3 years

#### Step 3: Counter-Notification Process

Allow users to submit counter-notices if they believe content was wrongly removed:

```markdown
## DMCA Counter-Notification

If your content was removed and you believe it was a mistake:

1. Your contact information
2. Identification of removed content
3. Statement under penalty of perjury that removal was erroneous
4. Consent to jurisdiction of federal court
5. Your physical or electronic signature

Send to: dmca@chillymovies.example.com

We will forward to original complainant and may restore content
after 10-14 business days unless complainant files legal action.
```

### Implementation in Code

Add to `src/torrent-search.ts`:

```typescript
// Blacklist management
const blacklistedHashes = new Set<string>();

export function blacklistTorrent(infoHash: string, reason: string): void {
  blacklistedHashes.add(infoHash.toLowerCase());
  logger.info('Torrent blacklisted', { infoHash, reason });
  // Persist to database
}

export function isBlacklisted(infoHash: string): boolean {
  return blacklistedHashes.has(infoHash.toLowerCase());
}

// Filter blacklisted torrents from results
function filterResults(results: TorrentResult[]): TorrentResult[] {
  return results.filter(t => !isBlacklisted(t.infoHash));
}
```

Add API endpoint to `src/api-server.ts`:

```typescript
// POST /admin/torrents/blacklist (requires admin auth)
app.post('/admin/torrents/blacklist', async (req, res) => {
  const { infoHash, reason } = req.body;
  
  // Verify admin authentication
  if (!isAdmin(req)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
  }
  
  blacklistTorrent(infoHash, reason);
  
  res.json({ success: true, message: 'Torrent blacklisted' });
});
```

## Regional Compliance Guidance

### High-Risk Jurisdictions

Countries with strict copyright enforcement or P2P restrictions:

**Tier 1 - Very High Risk**:
- üá∫üá∏ United States - Aggressive DMCA enforcement, ISP monitoring
- üá©üá™ Germany - High fines for copyright infringement
- üáØüáµ Japan - Criminal penalties for copyright violation
- üá¨üáß United Kingdom - Copyright infringement letters, ISP blocking
- üá¶üá∫ Australia - ISP cooperation with rights holders

**Recommendation**: Consider disabling torrent search by default or showing additional warnings in these regions.

**Tier 2 - Moderate Risk**:
- üá®üá¶ Canada - Notice-and-notice system
- üá´üá∑ France - HADOPI system (graduated response)
- üáÆüáπ Italy - ISP blocking of torrent sites
- üá™üá∏ Spain - Some enforcement, less aggressive

**Recommendation**: Show standard legal warnings, provide VPN recommendations.

**Tier 3 - Lower Risk**:
- Many African, Eastern European, and Asian countries have less enforcement
- Still illegal to download copyrighted content without permission
- Laws exist but enforcement may be limited

**Recommendation**: Still require opt-in and legal disclaimers.

### Implementation: Geo-Detection

```typescript
// src/geo-compliance.ts
import { lookupCountry } from 'geoip-lite';

export interface RegionPolicy {
  countryCode: string;
  riskLevel: 'high' | 'moderate' | 'low';
  torrentEnabled: boolean;
  additionalWarning?: string;
}

const REGION_POLICIES: Record<string, RegionPolicy> = {
  'US': {
    countryCode: 'US',
    riskLevel: 'high',
    torrentEnabled: false, // Require explicit override
    additionalWarning: 'Copyright infringement is a federal crime in the US with penalties up to $150,000 per work.'
  },
  'DE': {
    countryCode: 'DE',
    riskLevel: 'high',
    torrentEnabled: false,
    additionalWarning: 'Germany has very strict copyright enforcement with automatic fines.'
  },
  // ... more countries
};

export function getRegionPolicy(ip: string): RegionPolicy {
  const geo = lookupCountry(ip);
  if (!geo) {
    return { countryCode: 'UNKNOWN', riskLevel: 'high', torrentEnabled: false };
  }
  
  return REGION_POLICIES[geo] || {
    countryCode: geo,
    riskLevel: 'moderate',
    torrentEnabled: true
  };
}
```
