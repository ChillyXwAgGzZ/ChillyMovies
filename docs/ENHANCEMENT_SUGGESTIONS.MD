**Technical Implementation Guide: ChillyMovies UI Features**

Here is a detailed breakdown of how the core dynamic UI features of the ChillyMovies application were built.

**Filter Panel (Movies & TV Series Discovery Pages)**
The filter panel allows users to discover movies and TV shows by dynamically refining the results grid without page reloads.

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**
The entire filtering logic is encapsulated within the discovery page components themselves (src/app/[locale]/(main)/movies/page.tsx and src/app/[locale]/(main)/tv-series/page.tsx).

a. Component Structure & Layout:

The filter panel is a <Card> component from ShadCN UI, placed at the top of the page below the main title.
Inside the card, a responsive grid is used to lay out the filter controls:
On small screens (sm:), it's a 2-column grid.
On medium screens (md:), it becomes a 4-column grid, allowing the filter controls and the "Apply" button to align neatly in a row.
Each filter control is a <Select> dropdown component, paired with a <Label> for accessibility and clarity.

b. State Management:

The state for the selected filter values is managed locally within the page component using useState.

// In src/app/[locale]/(main)/movies/page.tsx

// State for each filter
const [selectedGenre, setSelectedGenre] = useState<string>('');
const [selectedYear, setSelectedYear] = useState<string>('');
const [selectedOrigin, setSelectedOrigin] = useState<string>('');

// State for results and pagination
const [movies, setMovies] = useState<TMDBBaseMovie[]>([]);
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
const [isLoadingInitial, setIsLoadingInitial] = useState(true);

c. Data Fetching & Dynamic Updates:

The core of the dynamic filtering is a centralized data fetching function, fetchMovieData, wrapped in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-creations.

useCallback for Fetching: The fetchMovieData function is memoized with useCallback. Its dependencies are the filter states (selectedGenre, selectedYear, selectedOrigin). This ensures the function reference remains stable unless a filter value actually changes.

const fetchMovieData = useCallback(async (page: number) => {
  // Set loading state
  if (page === 1) setIsLoadingInitial(true);
  
  // Build filters object to pass to the API
  const apiFilters: Record<string, any> = {};
  if (selectedGenre) apiFilters.with_genres = selectedGenre;
  if (selectedYear) apiFilters.primary_release_year = parseInt(selectedYear);
  if (selectedOrigin) apiFilters.with_origin_country = selectedOrigin;

  // Fetch data from TMDB lib
  const data = await discoverMovies(page, apiFilters);
  
  // Update state: Replace results if it's the first page, otherwise append.
  setMovies(prevMovies => page === 1 ? data.results : [...prevMovies, ...data.results]);
  setTotalPages(data.total_pages);
  
  // Reset loading state
  setIsLoadingInitial(false);
}, [selectedGenre, selectedYear, selectedOrigin, dictionary]); // Dependency array


Event Handling & Triggering Refetch:

When a user changes a filter's value (e.g., via the onValueChange prop of a <Select> component), it triggers a handler function like handleGenreChange.
This handler updates the corresponding filter state (setSelectedGenre(...)).
Crucially, it then calls a handleFilterChange() function. This function's job is to reset the pagination (setCurrentPage(1)) and then trigger a fresh data fetch by calling fetchMovieData(1).

const handleFilterChange = () => {
  // Reset pagination to page 1 for the new filter set
  setCurrentPage(1); 
  // Clear existing movies to show the loading skeleton for the new results
  setMovies([]);
  // Trigger the fetch for the new set of filters
  fetchMovieData(1); 
};

const handleGenreChange = (genreId: string) => {
  // Update the state
  setSelectedGenre(genreId === "0" ? "" : genreId);
  // Trigger the refetch
  handleFilterChange();
};

This approach ensures that any change to a filter resets the view to the first page of the new, filtered results.

d. Session Persistence (The Smart Part):

To provide a seamless user experience (e.g., preserving filters and scroll position when navigating back to the page), a DiscoveryPageState object is saved to sessionStorage before the user navigates away.

Saving State: An effect with a beforeunload event listener serializes the current filters, results, page number, and scroll position (window.scrollY) into a JSON object and saves it in sessionStorage.

Restoring State: On component mount, an effect checks for this saved state. If found, it bypasses the initial data fetch and instead rehydrates the component's state (setSelectedGenre, setMovies, etc.) with the saved data. window.scrollTo is used to restore the scroll position. This is wrapped in a setTimeout to ensure the DOM has rendered before attempting to scroll.

**Infinite Scroll**
The infinite scroll mechanism provides a fluid browsing experience by automatically loading more content as the user scrolls down.

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**
This feature is primarily implemented using the IntersectionObserver API, which is a modern, performant browser API for detecting when an element enters the viewport.

a. The Observer Hook:

A useCallback hook named lastMovieElementRef is created. This hook is designed to be attached as a ref to the last element in the results grid.

// In src/app/[locale]/(main)/movies/page.tsx

const observer = useRef<IntersectionObserver>();

const lastMovieElementRef = useCallback((node: HTMLElement | null) => {
  // If we are already loading new data, do nothing.
  if (isLoading || isLoadingInitial) return;

  // Disconnect the previous observer if it exists, to avoid observing an old element.
  if (observer.current) observer.current.disconnect();

  // Create a new IntersectionObserver.
  observer.current = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
    // If the last element is intersecting (i.e., visible on screen)
    // AND we haven't reached the last page of results...
    if (entries[0].isIntersecting && currentPage < totalPages) {
      // ...increment the current page number.
      setCurrentPage(prevPage => prevPage + 1);
    }
  });

  // If the node (the last element) exists, start observing it.
  if (node) observer.current.observe(node);
}, [isLoading, isLoadingInitial, currentPage, totalPages]);


b. Triggering the Data Fetch:

The lastMovieElementRef hook increments the currentPage state.

Another useEffect hook is set up to listen for changes to currentPage. When currentPage changes (and is greater than 1), it calls fetchMovieData(currentPage).

// This effect runs when `currentPage` changes.
useEffect(() => {
  // We only want this to fetch for pages after the first one.
  // The initial fetch is handled separately on mount.
  if (currentPage > 1) {
    fetchMovieData(currentPage);
  }
}, [currentPage, fetchMovieData]); // Dependency on currentPage and the fetch function



c. State Management & Appending Data:

This is the key to avoiding scroll jumps. The fetchMovieData function handles this logic:


// Inside fetchMovieData...
const data = await discoverMovies(page, apiFilters);

// The crucial part:
setMovies(prevMovies => 
  page === 1 
    ? data.results // If it's page 1, REPLACE the old data.
    : [...prevMovies, ...data.results] // Otherwise, APPEND the new results to the existing list.
);



By using the spread operator (...prevMovies) to append new results to the existing state, React efficiently adds the new movie cards to the DOM without re-rendering the entire grid. This preserves the user's scroll position naturally.

d. Attaching the ref to the Last Element:

In the JSX, we map over the movies array. Inside the map, we check if the current element is the last one in the array and conditionally attach the lastMovieElementRef.


<div className="grid ...">
  {movies.map((movie, index) => {
    const isLastMovie = movies.length === index + 1;
    return (
      <Link href="..." key={...}>
        <Card 
          // Attach the ref here ONLY for the last element
          ref={isLastMovie ? lastMovieElementRef : null}
          ...
        >
          {/* ... Card Content ... */}
        </Card>
      </Link>
    );
  })}
</div>


**Cards Grid Poster Layout**
The responsive grid of movie/TV posters is achieved with Tailwind CSS's grid system.

**Implementation Details**
a. Grid Container:

The container for the cards is a <div> with the following Tailwind classes:

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5 xl:grid-cols-6 gap-x-6 gap-y-8">
  <!-- Movie/TV Cards go here -->
</div>


grid: Establishes the grid layout.
grid-cols-2: The default is 2 columns for the smallest screens.
sm:grid-cols-3, md:grid-cols-4, etc.: These are responsive breakpoints. As the screen width increases, the number of columns in the grid grows, ensuring posters don't become excessively large.
gap-x-6 gap-y-8: Defines the horizontal (gap-x) and vertical (gap-y) spacing between grid items, creating a clean, breathable layout.
b. Card Component (RecommendedItemCard.tsx or similar):

Each item in the grid is a self-contained card component.

Aspect Ratio for Posters: To prevent layout shifts while images load, the image container is given a fixed aspect ratio. This is a crucial technique for a good user experience.


<div class="aspect-[2/3] relative w-full">
  <Image ... />
</div>

aspect-[2/3]: This Tailwind class sets a 2:3 aspect ratio (width:height), which is standard for movie posters. The container will hold this shape, and the Image component inside can fill it.
relative: The container must be relative for the absolute-positioned Next.js Image to fill it correctly.
Next.js Image Component:

fill: This prop makes the image fill its parent container (div with aspect ratio) completely.
object-cover: Ensures the image covers the entire area without being distorted, cropping as needed.
sizes: This attribute is important for performance. It tells the browser which image size to prioritize based on the viewport width, aligning with the responsive grid column counts.
priority: The priority prop is added to the first few images to tell Next.js to preload them, improving the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric.
By combining a responsive grid container with aspect-ratio-enforced image containers, the layout remains stable, looks professional across all devices, and performs well during infinite scroll updates.
