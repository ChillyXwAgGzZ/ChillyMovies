## Bug Fixes

### 1. Filter Panel Layout Bug ✅

**Issue:**  
When filtering by genres in MoviesView or TVSeriesView, movie cards only filled approximately half the screen width instead of utilizing the full available space.

**Root Cause:**  
The grid system was using insufficient responsive breakpoints:
- Original: `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5`
- This resulted in only 5 columns on ultra-wide screens, leaving significant white space

**Solution:**  
Extended the grid system with more breakpoints to better utilize wide screens:
```tsx
// Old
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5 gap-6">

// New
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5 xl:grid-cols-6 2xl:grid-cols-7 gap-6">
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/views/MoviesView.tsx`
- `src/renderer/views/TVSeriesView.tsx`

**Commit:** `8b3384c` - "fix: Improve grid responsiveness in Movies and TV Series views"

**Testing:**
- ✅ Mobile (320px-640px): 2 columns
- ✅ Small tablets (640px-768px): 3 columns
- ✅ Tablets (768px-1024px): 4 columns
- ✅ Laptops (1024px-1280px): 5 columns
- ✅ Desktops (1280px-1536px): 6 columns
- ✅ Ultra-wide (1536px+): 7 columns

### 2. Search Functionality Enhancement ✅

**Issue:**  
- Search replaced the entire page with results, losing context
- No live feedback while typing
- No visual preview of results
- Disruptive user experience

**User Request:**
> "The search should show live suggestions as I type (real-time results). The suggestions should include movie names and posters (not just text). The current page shouldn't disappear; the suggestions should appear as a dropdown below the search bar."

**Solution:**  
Implemented a comprehensive live search system:

1. **SearchSuggestions Component** (`src/renderer/components/SearchSuggestions.tsx`)
   - Dropdown appears below search bar
   - Shows up to 8 results with thumbnails
   - Displays poster images, titles, years, ratings, and media type badges
   - Smooth fade-in animation
   - Click outside or press Escape to close
   - Loading and error states

2. **Updated Header Component** (`src/renderer/components/Header.tsx`)
   - Added 300ms debounced live search
   - Search triggers on typing for suggestions
   - Enter key navigates to full results page
   - Click on suggestion navigates directly to detail page
   - Current page remains visible while searching

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time search with 300ms debounce
- ✅ Poster thumbnails (48x64px)
- ✅ Media type badges (Movie/TV)
- ✅ Rating and year display
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Escape to close)
- ✅ Click outside to close
- ✅ Loading spinner while searching
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ "Showing X of Y results" indicator

**Files Created:**
- `src/renderer/components/SearchSuggestions.tsx` (167 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Header.tsx`

**Commit:** `98313e6` - "feat: Add live search suggestions with dropdown"

### 3. Scroll Position Restoration Bug ✅

**Issue:**  
When navigating from Movies/TV list to a detail page and pressing back, the user was returned to the top of the list instead of their previous scroll position.

**Root Cause:**  
The scroll restoration code was targeting `window.scrollY` instead of the actual scrolling container (`main` element with `overflow-y-auto`).

**Solution:**  
Updated scroll position save/restore logic to target the correct DOM element:

```tsx
// Before
window.scrollTo(0, parseInt(savedPosition, 10));
sessionStorage.setItem(SCROLL_POSITION_KEY, window.scrollY.toString());

// After
const mainElement = document.querySelector('main');
if (mainElement) {
  mainElement.scrollTop = parseInt(savedPosition, 10);
  sessionStorage.setItem(SCROLL_POSITION_KEY, mainElement.scrollTop.toString());
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Uses `sessionStorage` to persist scroll position within the session
- Separate keys for Movies (`moviesView_scrollPosition`) and TV (`tvSeriesView_scrollPosition`)
- Restores position on mount with 100ms delay for DOM stability
- Saves position on unmount

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/views/MoviesView.tsx`
- `src/renderer/views/TVSeriesView.tsx`

**Commit:** `0fd7747` - "fix: Correct scroll position restoration in Movies and TV views"

### 4. Back Button Navigation Audit ✅

**Issue:**  
User reported some pages missing back button functionality.

**Findings:**  
After auditing all views, the back button implementation is correct:

**Pages WITH back buttons:**
- ✅ MovieDetailView (`src/renderer/views/MovieDetailView.tsx`)
- ✅ TVDetailView (`src/renderer/views/TVDetailView.tsx`)

**Pages WITHOUT back buttons (by design):**
- ✅ Home (accessed via sidebar)
- ✅ Movies (accessed via sidebar)
- ✅ TV Series (accessed via sidebar)
- ✅ Downloads (accessed via sidebar)
- ✅ Library (accessed via sidebar)
- ✅ Settings (accessed via sidebar)

**Rationale:**  
Main navigation pages are accessed via the persistent sidebar and don't require back buttons. Only deep pages (detail views) need back navigation, which is already implemented using `navigate(-1)`.

**Status:** No changes needed - implementation is correct ✅
