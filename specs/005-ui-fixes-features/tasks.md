## üî• Phase 1: Critical Bugs & Rendering Issues

**Goal**: Fix sidebar rendering bug and download panel UX issues (from user screenshots)

### 1.1 Sidebar Collapse Control Fix
- [ ] T001 [0.5h] [P0] **Investigate sidebar collapse button rendering**: Check if translation keys `sidebar.collapse` are missing in i18n files, verify button text appears in both collapsed/expanded states
  - Files: `src/renderer/i18n.ts`, `src/renderer/components/Sidebar.tsx`
  - Test: Toggle sidebar, verify "Collapse"/"Expand" text renders properly in both light/dark themes
  - Expected: Button shows chevron icon + text label consistently

### 1.2 Download Panel Fixes (Critical UX Issues)
- [ ] T002 [1h] [P0] **Fix Select All/Deselect All button state in light mode**: Buttons appear invisible/low contrast in light theme (see screenshot)
  - File: `src/renderer/components/DownloadPanel.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/EpisodeSelector.tsx`
  - Fix: Replace `from-gray-700 to-gray-600` with proper light/dark theme classes
  - Example: `bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-700 to-gray-600 dark:from-gray-700 dark:to-gray-600 hover:from-gray-600 hover:to-gray-500` ‚Üí `from-gray-200 to-gray-100 dark:from-gray-700 dark:to-gray-600 text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
  
- [ ] T003 [0.5h] [P0] **Replace "Start" label with "Download"** in all download buttons
  - Files: `src/renderer/components/DownloadPanel.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/EpisodeSelector.tsx`
  - Find: `{t("download.start")` ‚Üí Replace with `{t("download.button")` or `"Download"`
  - Update i18n keys if needed

- [ ] T004 [1.5h] [P1] **Fix auto-selection behavior**: Currently auto-selects ALL torrents; should only auto-select the smallest torrent for chosen quality
  - File: `src/renderer/components/DownloadPanel.tsx` (line ~70-80)
  - Current: `setSelectedTorrent(best)` after sorting
  - Add: Checkbox selection per torrent, allow manual override
  - Default: Auto-check smallest torrent, but user can uncheck/select different one
  
- [ ] T005 [1h] [P1] **Show full torrent details before download**: Display chosen torrent name, quality, size, estimated download time
  - File: `src/renderer/components/DownloadPanel.tsx` footer section
  - Add: Expandable "Selected Torrent Details" section above Download button
  - Include: Full title, quality badge, size (GB/MB), seeders/leechers count

- [ ] T006 [2h] [P2] **TV series per-episode quality selection**: Allow setting quality per episode OR apply season-wide quality after confirmation
  - File: `src/renderer/components/EpisodeSelector.tsx`
  - Add: "Set quality for all selected episodes" dropdown in footer
  - Workflow: Select episodes ‚Üí Choose quality ‚Üí Preview total size ‚Üí Confirm download
  - Show: Total estimated size for all selected episodes

**Checkpoint**: Download panel UX is clear, predictable, and works in both light/dark themes
