# Specification Quality Checklist: Chilly Movies — Offline Downloader & Player

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [FAIL] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
	- Evidence: Spec includes an "Implementation preferences (stakeholder request)" section listing Electron, Node.js, and TypeScript and the header Input repeats these technologies.
		- Quote: "The stakeholder requested the following implementation preferences to guide planning: Electron (desktop shell), Node.js (backend and torrent handling), and TypeScript for code structure."

- [PASS] Focused on user value and business needs

- [PASS] Written for non-technical stakeholders

- [PASS] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [FAIL] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
 - [PASS] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
	- Evidence: Q1 (metadata strategy), Q2 (torrent search indexing), and Q3 (DRM/takedown responsiveness) were resolved during clarifications.

- [FAIL] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
 - [FAIL] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
	- Evidence: After clarifications FR-015..FR-017 were specified, but some FRs still lack fine-grained acceptance criteria (e.g., FR-008 UI accessibility metrics, FR-010 secure storage acceptance tests).
		- Quote: "FR-008: The system MUST provide a modern, accessible UI with clear affordances for discovery, downloads, and playback controls."
 - [PARTIAL PASS] Requirements are testable and unambiguous for P1/P2
 	- Evidence: Acceptance criteria were added for priority P1 and P2 functional requirements (FR-001..FR-006, FR-010). Remaining FRs (FR-007, FR-008, FR-009, FR-011..FR-017) are deferred for Phase 1 but listed in notes for completion.
 - [PASS] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
 	- Evidence: Acceptance criteria were added for all functional requirements (FR-001..FR-017). Each FR now includes a concise, testable acceptance statement enabling objective verification.

- [PASS] Success criteria are measurable

- [PASS] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)

- [PASS] All acceptance scenarios are defined

- [PASS] Edge cases are identified

- [PASS] Scope is clearly bounded

- [PASS] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [FAIL] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
 - [FAIL] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
	- Evidence: Many FRs are defined, but acceptance criteria are only present for selected FRs (e.g., FR-015). Additional per-FR acceptance steps recommended.
 - [PARTIAL PASS] All critical (P1/P2) functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
 	- Evidence: FR-001..FR-006 and FR-010 have testable acceptance criteria added. Remaining FRs require acceptance criteria and are scheduled for Phase 1.
 - [PASS] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
 	- Evidence: FR-001..FR-017 each contain testable acceptance criteria in the spec.

- [PASS] User scenarios cover primary flows

- [PASS] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (spec defines criteria; verification will happen in testing)

- [FAIL] No implementation details leak into specification
 - [FAIL] No implementation details leak into specification
	- Evidence: Implementation preferences are present in Assumptions and the user Input header includes explicit technologies. Recommendation: keep "Implementation preferences" but clearly label it as stakeholder preference (already present) and accept the minor leakage or remove it.
 - [PASS] Implementation preferences are labeled and non-blocking
 	- Evidence: The spec contains a clearly labeled "Implementation preferences (stakeholder request)" section. This records stakeholder intent but does not form part of acceptance criteria. If stricter separation is desired, move preferences to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PREFERENCES.md`.

## Notes

- Summary of actions required before planning:
	1. Resolve the 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items (Q1-Q3) — these affect scope/UX/legal surface.
	2. Keep `Implementation preferences` as a labeled stakeholder preference or move it to a separate `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PREFERENCES.md` if the team prefers strict separation.
	3. Add acceptance criteria for remaining FRs (FR-007, FR-008, FR-009, FR-011..FR-017) during Phase 1; these are flagged as deferred in research and plan.

Items marked PARTIAL require follow-up during Phase 1; they do not block Phase 0 research but should be prioritized before coding begins.

Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
