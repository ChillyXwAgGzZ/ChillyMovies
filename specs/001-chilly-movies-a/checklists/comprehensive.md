[Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §Edge Cases] — ✅ User Story 1 describes "optional metadata sync"; Edge Cases include "offline installation without initial sync: app must still allow adding local files"

[Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-017] — ✅ Edge Cases: "geo-restricted sources or removed YouTube content: surface user-friendly errors and alternatives"; FR-017 acceptance details takedown workflow and disabled-source UI
- [x] CHK018 Are multiple concurrent downloads and storage management scenarios fully documented, including how conflicts are resolved? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-005] — ✅ Edge Cases: "multiple concurrent downloads exceeding disk space: warn user and prevent data loss"; FR-005 manages concurrent downloads locally

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK019 Are fallback behaviors defined when TMDB rate limits hit or metadata fetch fails, including cached or bundled metadata expectations? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-015, Tasks §TASK-R10] — ✅ FR-011 specifies retry with cached data fallback; FR-015 defines hybrid metadata with bundled core; TASK-R10 completed with caching layer and rate-limit handling
- [x] CHK020 Are restart-after-crash or forced app close scenarios addressed for download resumption and state reconciliation? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Tasks §TASK-I1] — ✅ Edge Cases: "interrupted downloads across restarts: download state must persist and resume on app restart"; TASK-I1 implements ResumeManager for state persistence
- [x] CHK021 Are disk-full or quota-exceeded responses defined with warnings, blocking behavior, and user recovery steps? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-005] — ✅ Edge Cases: "multiple concurrent downloads exceeding disk space: warn user and prevent data loss"; FR-005 manages downloads locally with state visibility

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK022 Are performance targets (start-to-frame timing, search responsiveness) decomposed into measurable thresholds per platform and storage class? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003] — ✅ SC-002: "95% playback start within 5s (SSD) / 10s (HDD)"; SC-003: "90% search accuracy against 100-title dataset"; TASK-R1 validates indexing performance

[Non-Functional, Spec §FR-017, Tasks §TASK-R4, docs/LEGAL_COMPLIANCE.md] — ✅ FR-016 requires opt-in with "clear legal guidance and region restrictions"; FR-017 defines takedown mechanism; TASK-R4 completed with comprehensive legal docs (TERMS_OF_SERVICE, PRIVACY_POLICY, DMCA_PROCESS, LEGAL_COMPLIANCE)

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK026 Are TMDB/YouTube dependency assumptions (API keys, rate limits, caching) explicitly captured with mitigation steps if external services change? [Dependencies, Clarifications §API Quota, Tasks §TASK-R10] — ✅ Clarifications: "Hybrid: app-managed rate-limited key + aggressive caching; user-supplied key for bulk syncs"; TASK-R10 completed with cache layer (30min/1hr TTL) and rate-limit handling
- [x] CHK027 Are OS-level secure storage dependencies and fallback conditions documented for each platform to avoid hidden implementation gaps? [Dependencies, Spec §FR-010, Plan §Technical Context] — ✅ FR-010 acceptance enumerates: "Keychain (macOS), Credential Manager (Windows), libsecret (Linux); fallback to strong encrypted file if unavailable"; TASK-R7 implements all platforms with fallback
- [x] CHK028 Are packaging tool decisions and prerequisite runtimes called out so installers can validate environment assumptions ahead of release? [Dependencies, Tasks §TASK-R5, Plan §Project Structure] — ✅ Plan Technical Context: "Node.js >=18 LTS, Electron >=25, TypeScript >=4.9"; TASK-R5 completed: electron-builder chosen; package.json engines specifies "node": ">=18"

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK029 Is there any lingering ambiguity between "optional telemetry export" and success criteria ensuring zero transmission by default that needs reconciliation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-014, Spec §SC-005] — ✅ NO AMBIGUITY: FR-014 and SC-005 both specify "no telemetry by default"; telemetry requires "explicit opt-in"; TASK-R8 tests verify zero transmission when disabled
- [x] CHK030 Is the optional torrent indexing feature clearly marked as opt-in everywhere so it cannot be enabled implicitly or by default? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-016, Tasks §TASK-I9] — ✅ NO AMBIGUITY: FR-016 uses "MAY include optional" and requires "explicit, opt-in" with legal guidance; TASK-I9 implements opt-in pattern; TASK-R4 legal docs enforce opt-in requirement
- [x] CHK031 Do edge case requirements for bundled metadata vs. optional sync avoid conflicting expectations about initial search completeness? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-015, Spec §User Story 1] — ✅ NO CONFLICT: FR-015 clarifies "hybrid initial metadata strategy: bundled core for immediate basic discovery + optional sync for richer metadata"; User Story 1 describes "optional metadata sync"; both aligned on hybrid approach
