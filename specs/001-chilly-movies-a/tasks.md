## Phase 3: Bug Fixes & Enhancements (Post-Detail Pages)

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Branch:** `004-004-theme-fetch`  
**Related:** [bug-fixes-phase3.md](../005-ui-fixes-features/bug-fixes-phase3.md)

### BUG-001: Filter Panel Grid Layout

**Priority**: P1  
**Estimated Time**: 0.5h  
**Actual Time**: 0.5h  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue:**  
Movie/TV cards only filled ~50% of screen width when filtering by genres.

**Solution:**  
Extended grid responsive breakpoints from 5 to 7 columns:
- Added `sm:grid-cols-3` for small tablets
- Added `xl:grid-cols-6` for desktops
- Added `2xl:grid-cols-7` for ultra-wide screens

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/views/MoviesView.tsx`
- `src/renderer/views/TVSeriesView.tsx`

**Commit:** `8b3384c`

**Priority**: P1  
**Estimated Time**: 2h  
**Actual Time**: 2h  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue:**  
Search replaced entire page, no live feedback, poor UX.

**Solution:**  
Implemented live search dropdown with:
- Real-time suggestions (300ms debounce)
- Poster thumbnails
- Media type badges
- Rating and year display
- Click outside/Escape to close
- Enter key for full results

### BUG-003: Scroll Position Restoration

**Priority**: P1  
**Estimated Time**: 1h  
**Actual Time**: 0.5h  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue:**  
Scroll position lost when returning to Movies/TV views from detail pages.

**Root Cause:**  
Code was targeting `window.scrollY` instead of `main` element's `scrollTop`.

**Solution:**  
Fixed scroll save/restore to target correct DOM element:
```tsx
const mainElement = document.querySelector('main');
mainElement.scrollTop = parseInt(savedPosition, 10);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/views/MoviesView.tsx`
- `src/renderer/views/TVSeriesView.tsx`

**Commit:** `0fd7747`
