# Download System Fixes & Improvements Plan

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Priority:** P0 CRITICAL

## üêõ Critical Issues Identified

### 1. ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED (BLOCKING)
**Impact:** Downloads completely broken  
**Root Cause:** `create-torrent@6.1.0` (WebTorrent dependency) has ESM export issues with tsx/Node.js  
**Error:** `No "exports" main defined in /workspaces/ChilluMovies/node_modules/create-torrent/package.json`

**Solutions (in order of preference):**
- **A.** Downgrade `webtorrent` to v1.x which uses CommonJS (fastest)
- **B.** Use Aria2 downloader instead of WebTorrent (better long-term)
- **C.** Add module resolution fixes in tsconfig/package.json
- **D.** Fork and fix create-torrent package

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours  
**Chosen Solution:** A + B (downgrade for quick fix, then migrate to Aria2)

---

### 2. UI Torrent Selection Issue
**Impact:** Users can't choose specific torrents  
**Current Behavior:** Shows multiple torrents but only has single "Start" button  
**Expected Behavior:** Let users select which specific torrent to download

**Solution:**
- Add radio buttons or click-to-select for each torrent card
- Highlight selected torrent visually
- Auto-select best torrent by default (already done)
- Show clear "Selected" indicator

**Time Estimate:** 1 hour

---

### 3. UI/UX Polish Needed
**Issues:**
- No loading animations during torrent search
- Error messages not styled properly
- No transition animations
- Download progress not visible after starting
- Success state unclear

**Improvements:**
- Smooth modal animations (fade in/out)
- Skeleton loading for torrent cards
- Better error styling with retry button
- Download started ‚Üí auto-redirect with progress indicator
- Add download progress badge to Downloads nav item

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

---

### 4. TV Series Download Not Implemented
**Current State:** Uses same download panel as movies (doesn't support episodes)  
**Required Features:**
- Season/Episode selector
- Batch download (entire season or multiple episodes)
- Episode-specific torrent search
- Progress tracking per episode
- Queue management

**Time Estimate:** 6-8 hours
