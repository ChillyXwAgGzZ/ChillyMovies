## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

Q: Add per-FR acceptance criteria now or limit to high-priority FRs? → A: Option B — Add acceptance criteria only for priority P1/P2 FRs (core & high-impact).
Q: How should sensitive credentials/API keys be stored? → A: Option A — Use OS-level secure storage (Keychain on macOS, Windows Credential Manager, libsecret/Secret Service on Linux).
Q: Should FR-008 (UI accessibility) have explicit, testable acceptance criteria? → A: Option A — Add explicit, testable accessibility acceptance criteria (WCAG AA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
Q: What is the target local library size for sizing/indexing decisions? → A: Option B — Medium: 1,000–10,000 items.
Q: What is the observability and telemetry posture? → A: Option B — Local structured logs by default, optional opt-in telemetry export (pseudonymous, minimal) with explicit consent and retention policy.

- Q: What is the API quota and discovery key strategy for TMDB/YouTube? → A: Option D — Hybrid: app-managed, rate-limited key for light discovery + aggressive local caching and throttling; require/encourage user-supplied API key for bulk/one-time syncs or heavy usage.

- Q: How should transient network/download failures be handled (retry UX)? → A: Option A — Automatic retries with exponential backoff (3 attempts) and clear UI fallback to cached data.

**FR-008**: The system MUST provide a modern, accessible UI with clear affordances for discovery, downloads, and playback controls.
  **Acceptance**: The UI passes automated accessibility tests (axe-core or equivalent) for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance on all primary screens; all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable; screen reader labels are present for all actionable controls; color contrast meets AA thresholds; accessibility test results are included in the QA report for each release.


## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Install, Sync, and Play Offline (Priority: P1)

A user installs Chilly Movies on their desktop, performs an initial optional metadata sync (when online), adds or downloads a movie or episode from a chosen source (torrent or YouTube), and is able to play that media completely offline later.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition — reliable, local-first playback without cloud dependencies.

**Independent Test**: Install app, perform initial sync and a single download, then disconnect network and verify the media is discoverable and plays start-to-finish without any network access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a freshly installed app and a stable internet connection, **When** the user performs initial sync and downloads a selected movie, **Then** the media and its metadata are stored locally and appear in the local library.
2. **Given** the media is in the local library and the system is offline, **When** the user opens the app and selects the media, **Then** playback starts and continues without network access and controls (seek, pause, resume) function correctly.

---

### User Story 2 - Discover & Add Content (Priority: P2)

Users can discover content using integrated metadata (TMDB) and select a source (YouTube, torrent magnet/link or local file) to add to the download queue. The UI surfaces metadata (title, synopsis, poster, release year, cast) in Swahili or English.

**Why this priority**: Discovery and easy addition of content is the primary onramp to building the local library.

**Independent Test**: Search for a title, inspect metadata, choose a source, add to download queue, and confirm a corresponding download job is created and tracked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an online environment, **When** the user searches a movie/TV title, **Then** the app shows matching TMDB metadata and allows the user to pick a source to download.

---

### User Story 3 - Manage Downloads & Playback Preferences (Priority: P3)

Users can monitor download progress, pause/resume/remove downloads, select subtitle tracks, choose audio tracks where available, and manage storage locations. UI supports Swahili-English language toggle and remembers preference.

**Why this priority**: Download management and playback quality are necessary for a reliable offline experience and user satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Start multiple downloads, pause one, resume it, select a subtitle during playback, and confirm language preference persists across app relaunches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** several active downloads, **When** the user pauses one job, **Then** that job halts and can be resumed later.
2. **Given** a playing video with multiple subtitle tracks, **When** the user switches subtitles, **Then** the subtitle track changes immediately.

---

### Edge Cases

- Offline installation without initial sync: app must still allow adding local files and playing them.
- Partial or corrupted downloads: app must detect and surface repair or redownload options.
- Interrupted downloads across restarts: download state must persist and resume on app restart.
- Geo-restricted sources or removed YouTube content: surface user-friendly errors and alternatives.
- Multiple concurrent downloads exceeding disk space: warn user and prevent data loss.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to install and run a fully self-contained desktop application on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  **Acceptance**: Given a supported OS installer, when the user completes installation and launches the app, then the main window opens, the local library index can be created, and no network is required to browse bundled metadata.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a local media library that stores downloaded media files, accompanying metadata, subtitles, and playback state on the user's machine.
  **Acceptance**: Given media and metadata present on-disk, when the user opens the app offline, then the media items appear in the library and playback can start to first frame.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow discovery of movies and TV series metadata via TMDB (search, details, posters, cast) when online.
  **Acceptance**: Given network connectivity and a query, when the user searches a title, then TMDB matches are returned and the UI displays title, poster, year, and synopsis.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow the user to add content to a download queue from supported sources: YouTube (video URL) and torrent (magnet link or .torrent file).  
  **Acceptance**: Given a valid YouTube URL or magnet link, when the user adds it to the queue, then a DownloadJob is created with status `queued` or `active` and visible progress in the downloads UI.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST manage torrent and external-source downloads locally (no external servers required); users can start, pause, resume, and cancel downloads, and view progress and estimated time remaining.
  **Acceptance**: Given an active download job, when the user selects pause/resume/cancel, then the job transitions to the corresponding state and disk writes pause or resume without data corruption; progress updates reflect actual bytes written.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST store all metadata and downloaded assets locally so playback and library browsing work fully offline after the content and metadata have been synced or downloaded.
  **Acceptance**: After a successful download completes, when the user disconnects network access and reopens the app, then library browsing, metadata display, and playback succeed for that media without network calls.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide a bilingual UI (Swahili and English) with an obvious setting to switch languages; the selection must be persisted across sessions.
  **Acceptance**: Given the UI language selector, when the user switches to Swahili or English and restarts the app, then all primary UI strings reflect the selected language and the preference is persisted across sessions; localization tests verify key flows in both languages.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide a modern, accessible UI with clear affordances for discovery, downloads, and playback controls.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST support local subtitle loading and downloading (when available) and allow the user to select subtitle tracks during playback.
  **Acceptance**: Given media with multiple subtitle tracks or local subtitle files, when the user selects a subtitle track during playback, then the subtitle track switches within 1 second and persists for that media; subtitle download attempts surface success/failure and store subtitle files alongside media.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide secure, local-only storage of user preferences and library indexes (no cloud upload by default).
  **Acceptance**: Given stored preferences and indexes, when the app is closed and reopened, then preferences persist and sensitive items (API keys) are stored in the OS-provided secure storage (Keychain / Credential Manager / libsecret) where available; where OS store is unavailable, secrets are stored encrypted at rest using a strong, auditable algorithm.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST surface clear error and status messages for network, disk, and source-specific failures.
  **Acceptance**: When transient network or source errors occur, the system automatically retries failed operations with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts; the UI shows progressive status and a clear final error if retries fail. Cached data or fallback UI is shown when available. Retry behavior must be logged in structured logs for later analysis.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide a settings area where users can configure storage location, language, bandwidth limits for downloads, and (optionally) schedule metadata syncs.
  **Acceptance**: Given the settings UI, when the user changes storage location, language, bandwidth limits, or sync schedule and saves, then the preferences persist across restarts and take effect immediately for new downloads or sync jobs; invalid values are rejected with clear error messages.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST gracefully handle removal of externally stored content (e.g., file moved/deleted) and allow re-linking or re-download.
  **Acceptance**: When a media file referenced in the library is missing at startup or during playback, the UI shows a clear 'missing file' state with options to re-link a local file or re-download; attempting playback of a missing file must not crash the app and must log the incident.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST respect user privacy: no telemetry or cloud syncing without explicit opt-in and clear informed consent.
  **Acceptance**: By default, no telemetry or user data is transmitted off-device; when the user enables telemetry, the settings store the opt-in state, only minimal pseudonymous metrics defined in documentation are sent, and retention/opt-out flows are honored; tests verify no network telemetry is sent when opt-in is false.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-015**: The system MUST perform initial metadata sync behavior as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the app require an initial online sync to be fully functional offline, or should it ship with a minimal bundled metadata set?]
 - **FR-015**: The system MUST adopt a hybrid initial metadata strategy: ship with a small bundled core metadata set that enables immediate basic desktop/local-first discovery and provide an optional first-time online sync that fetches richer metadata for the full library.  
   **Acceptance**: After install, basic searches return items included in the bundled core metadata; when the user runs the optional sync (one-time), the local library is enriched and full search results become available while preserving offline operation.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST support content discovery via torrent indexing/search as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the app include built-in torrent search/indexing, or should discovery be limited to TMDB metadata + user-supplied magnet/URL?]
 - **FR-016**: The system MAY include optional built-in torrent search/indexing as a user-configurable feature. If enabled, search/indexing functionality must be explicit, opt-in, and include clear legal guidance and region restrictions where required.  
   **Acceptance**: When the user enables built-in torrent search, the UI exposes a search panel returning indexed torrent sources; the user can disable indexing and the app will stop the indexing service and remove local index data on request.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST comply with legal and DRM constraints as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Clarify how the product should handle DRM-protected content and legal takedown considerations].
 - **FR-017**: The system MUST provide clear handling for DRM-protected content and legal takedown responsiveness: DRM-protected streams are not supported by default, and the product MUST include a mechanism for users to report problematic sources and for the application to disable or mark specific sources as unavailable when a validated takedown or restriction is applied.
   **Acceptance**: The app provides a local "report source" action that flags a source for review. When the user runs an optional metadata sync (or when a curated takedown list is provided via signed updates), the app will disable flagged sources from discovery and mark them as unavailable in the local library. The UI surfaces a clear reason and guidance to the user when a source is disabled.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **MediaItem**: Represents a single movie/episode; attributes: title, original_title, tmdb_id, local_paths (video, subtitle), poster_path, release_year, runtime, language(s), audio_tracks, subtitle_tracks, metadata_synced_at.
- **Library**: Collection of MediaItems indexed on the local machine; attributes: storage_path, total_size, item_count, last_indexed_at.
- **DownloadJob**: Represents an active or queued download; attributes: id, source_type (torrent|youtube|local), source_urn (magnet/url/file), progress, speed, estimated_time, status, peers (for torrents), error_state.
- **UserPreferences**: UI language, storage_location, bandwidth_limits, auto_sync_schedule, privacy_settings.
- **MetadataSource**: TMDB (metadata provider) — used only when online to fetch additional details.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: After initial sync and at least one successful media download, 100% of core library actions (browse, play, stop, seek, subtitle toggle) function while the system is offline.
- **SC-002**: 95% of normal playback sessions start within 5 seconds on an SSD-class disk and within 10 seconds on typical HDD-class disk (measured cold start of selected media tile to first frame).
- **SC-003**: At least 90% of basic discovery searches return correct TMDB matches for common popular titles in the dataset (measured against a curated 100-title list).
- **SC-004**: 90% of users can complete the primary task—find a title, add to downloads, and begin playback—in no more than 3 explicit actions (search → add → play) in a usability test with 10 participants.
- **SC-005**: No telemetry or user data is transmitted off-device by default; any opt-in telemetry must be explicitly enabled and documented in settings.

## Assumptions

- The user is responsible for the legality of the content they download; the product will provide clear guidance but does not guarantee legal compliance for user actions.
- The app may require an initial online connection to fetch TMDB metadata and resolve YouTube/torrent sources; however, once metadata and media assets are downloaded, the app must work fully offline.
 - The app uses a hybrid metadata approach: it ships with a small bundled core metadata set for immediate desktop/local-first use; users may optionally run a first-time online sync to download richer metadata for fuller discovery.
 - Target library size for design and indexing is Medium (1,000–10,000 items); components and benchmarks should validate performance across this range.
- TMDB API usage will follow TMDB terms; the product will surface a config location for an API key or use an app-managed key where permitted.
- Platform packaging (Windows/macOS/Linux) will use platform-appropriate installers but those implementation details belong to planning and not to this spec.

### Implementation preferences (stakeholder request)

- The stakeholder requested the following implementation preferences to guide planning: Electron (desktop shell), Node.js (backend and torrent handling), and TypeScript for code structure. These are recorded as stakeholder preferences and do not constrain the success criteria or user-facing requirements in this specification.

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- No cloud library, cloud syncing, or mandatory online account creation for core functionality.
- No built-in DRM circumvention; the app will not attempt to bypass DRM on protected streams.
- No server-side indexing or hosting of torrent indexes.

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- The application stores all media and metadata locally by default and must encrypt sensitive preferences (if storing credentials) and clearly surface any optional telemetry for explicit opt-in.
- The app must avoid embedding third-party trackers by default.

## Maintenance & Operational Notes

- Provide a visible mechanism for users to clear cache and rebuild the local index.
- Offer an export/import for library metadata and user preferences to help users migrate between machines (local file only).

## Appendix: Questions and Clarifications

1. Resolved: Initial metadata strategy set to Hybrid (small bundled core metadata + optional first-time sync).
2. Resolved: Built-in torrent search/indexing is OPTIONAL and must be opt-in with clear legal guidance.
3. Resolved: Takedown responsiveness required — provide local report mechanism and optional synced takedown lists to disable/mark sources.
