# Tasks: Theme Propagation, Fetch Fixes & UI Polish

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-004-theme-fetch/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project setup and investigation

- [x] T001 [P] Run theme audit: grep all src/renderer files for hardcoded dark styles (`bg-gray-800`, `text-white`, etc.)
- [ ] T002 [P] Reproduce movie/TV detail page fetch errors: navigate to `/movie/550` and `/tv/1396`, capture network logs
- [ ] T003 [P] Analyze current sidebar code in `src/renderer/components/Sidebar.tsx` for UX issues

**Checkpoint**: Issues documented, ready to fix

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core fixes that enable user story work

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Theme propagation work blocks all visual polish tasks

- [x] T004 Verify ThemeContext is working: test theme persistence in localStorage, check if `actualTheme` updates correctly
- [ ] T005 Investigate TMDB API integration in `src/renderer/services/api.ts`: check endpoint construction, error handling, CORS setup
- [ ] T006 Fix TMDB API calls in `metadataApi.getDetails()` if root cause is backend (endpoint mismatch, missing API key, etc.)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - theme system validated, API integration debugged

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Consistent Theme Experience (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: All UI elements respect user's theme choice without hardcoded dark styles

**Independent Test**: Toggle theme in Settings, navigate to all pages/modals, verify light theme displays correctly everywhere

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T007 [P] [US1] Refactor `src/renderer/views/SettingsView.tsx`: replace hardcoded `bg-gray-800`, `text-white` with theme-aware classes (`bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`, `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - HIGH PRIORITY (theme propagation is foundational for polish)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational - HIGH PRIORITY (fetch fixes are critical for app functionality), can run in parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 completion (sidebar needs theme fixes first)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 completion (visual polish needs consistent theme)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US3 and US4 completion (a11y audit after layout/styling stable)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### Recommended Execution Order

1. **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001-T003 - Run audits and investigation (1-2 hours)
2. **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T004-T006 - Fix theme/API issues (2-4 hours)
3. **Phase 3 (US1 - Theme Propagation)**: T007-T017 - Fix all theme issues (4-6 hours)
4. **Phase 4 (US2 - Fetch Fixes)**: T018-T025 - Fix movie/TV detail pages (3-4 hours) [Can run in parallel with US1]
5. **Phase 5 (US3 - Sidebar Redesign)**: T026-T035 - Refactor sidebar (3-4 hours)
6. **Phase 6 (US4 - Visual Polish)**: T036-T045 - Polish all pages (4-6 hours)
7. **Phase 7 (US5 - Accessibility & i18n)**: T046-T056 - Accessibility and i18n validation (3-4 hours)
8. **Phase 8 (Final Polish)**: T057-T062 - Final tests and docs (2-3 hours)

**Total Estimated Effort**: 22-34 hours

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: Tasks T004 and T005-T006 can run in parallel (theme validation vs. API investigation)
- **Phase 3**: All component refactors (T007-T015) can run in parallel if multiple developers available
- **Phase 4**: Tests (T018-T019) can run in parallel, then implementation tasks (T020-T023) in sequence
- **Phase 5**: Tests (T026-T027) can run in parallel, implementation tasks (T028-T035) mostly sequential
- **Phase 6**: All view refactors (T036-T042) can run in parallel
- **Phase 7**: Tests (T046-T048) and some implementation tasks (T049-T052) can run in parallel
- **Phase 8**: T057-T059 can run in parallel

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently testable
- Theme propagation (US1) blocks visual polish work (US4) - fix theme first
- Fetch fixes (US2) are independent and can proceed in parallel with theme work
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at each checkpoint to validate story independently
